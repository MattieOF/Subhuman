- scrGeneralUtilitys debris layer could be invalid after a room change. Fix this - perhaps a function that checks
for its existence that should be called on room start - init_general_utility()?

- Enemy AI
	- Pathfinding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmOqnp5d33Q
	- Siphonorator
	- Summoned enemies - Ticks (they just charge at you)
- Item system
- Inventory system - likely similar to the loadout system but with a limit to the items you can carry
	- For simplicitys sake, each item will only take up one inventory slot
	- Need a HUD for all this
- Breakables
- Locked doors (or otherwise things that require an item or weapon to bypass).
- Completed demo level
- Win screen; summary of player score
	- Perhaps a small new game+ thing
- Art lol
- Sound
- Unlockables (notes, concept art, secret level - maybe you could visit the movement test lol)
- Unlockables menu

- Most importantly: remake the game in a decent engine
